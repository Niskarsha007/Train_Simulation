The first part that is required is an appropriate Python IDE.
I recommend Anaconda Spyder, as this is what this project was written using.
This will also require Python to be installed.

To install the necessary modules, it will require the use of a command line.
This can be done on windows but, if using Anaconda Spyder as recommended, the Anaconda Prompt should be used.

In the prompt, you must make sure pip is installed.
This will allow a user to install the modules required to run the MRMS.
Run the following.
-	py -m ensurepip â€“upgrade

Once pip is installed, a user can then run the following.
-	pip install git+https://github.com/remykarem/py2pddl#egg=py2pddl
-	pip install pddl_parser
-	pip install pygame

Once these steps are completed, the MRMS should be able to run.
